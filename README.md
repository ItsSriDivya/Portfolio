# Portfolio: https://itssridivya.github.io/portfolio/

A UI application inspired from the idea of presenting my details (portfolio) in a fun way built using my proficient skills. 
	Application includes concepts like react routing, react hooks, redux, css animations.
	Tried my hands on building two apis using python flask and display information by hitting them from UI.
	Deployed python flask using Vercel: https://portfolio-api-vercel-fxhb9jm2q-itssridivya.vercel.app/ .
	Designed both the home page and portfolio page myself by exploring different design ideas and samples for flow of portfolio.
